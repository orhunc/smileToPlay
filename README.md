# smileToPlay
an interactive video installation controlled by emotions 




"Smile to Play" is an interactive video that invites players to engage through facial expressions. Guided by a virtual assistant named Xat, it delves into two main topics. First, it explores the complex dynamics of human/non-human encounters in relation to the recognition of emotion, highlighting the expanding industry known as "affective computing". Second, it examines the concept of happiness and its instrumentalization in neoliberal societies.
